# 🚀 SpaceX Falcon 9 Launch Success Prediction
IBM Data Science Capstone Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is the final capstone of the **IBM Data Science Professional Certificate**.  
The objective is to analyze historical **SpaceX Falcon 9 launch data** and build machine learning models to **predict the success of first-stage landings**.

Successful recovery of the Falcon 9 first stage plays a critical role in reducing launch costs. This project applies end-to-end data science techniques to uncover insights and build predictive models that support data-driven decision making.
